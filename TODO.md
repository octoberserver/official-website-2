# TODO
1. Use open source photo gallery, or make one which uploads and downloads images from tucker's web drive
2. Announcement connection system
3. Connect downloads to omms
4. Would be good if we can somehow move the website into cloud and decouple the downloads and announcement page data by pushing it to github on the backend and fetching from github on the frontend which eliminates the need for the backend to be online 24/7
5. Add tutorial link after it is hosted
